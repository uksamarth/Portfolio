# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here you will find a collection of my projects, showcasing my skills and work in various areas such as machine learning, computer vision, and web development.

## Projects

### 1. Multimodal Facial Expression Recognition
- **Description**: Developed a user interface to capture live audio and video streams in real-time to determine facial expressions. The system can act as a customer feedback tool in shopping malls.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Multimodal Machine Learning, Computer Vision
- **Repository**: [Multimodal Facial Expression Recognition](https://github.com/uksamarth/Multimodal-Emotion-Recognition)

### 2. QR-based Ticket Booking System
- **Description**: Created a secure QR-based ticket booking system with real-time QR code validation and turnstile access control using Raspberry PI-4B. Integrated payment processing via Stripe and user authentication with NextAuth v5.
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, MongoDB, Stripe, NextAuth v5, Raspberry PI-4B
- **Repository**: [QR-based Ticket Booking System](https://github.com/uksamarth/Qr-Tickets)

### 3. Underwater Image Enhancement towards NeRF-based 3D Reconstruction
- **Description**: Focuses on enhancing underwater images to achieve more accurate 3D reconstructions using NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) technology. Addresses challenges such as haze, color distortion, and low contrast in underwater imaging.
- **Tech Stack**: Image Processing, NeRF, Python, Meshlab
- **Repository**: [Underwater Image Enhancement towards NeRF-based 3D Reconstruction](https://github.com/uksamarth/Underwater-Image-Enhancement-towards-NeRF-based-3D-Reconstruction)

### 4. A Deep Learning Approach for Kannada Handwritten Character Recognition
- **Description**: Utilized transfer learning techniques with pre-trained CNN models to improve recognition accuracy for Kannada handwritten characters, achieving 97.50% accuracy after training for 50 epochs.
- **Tech Stack**: Machine Learning, Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Repository**: [Kannada Handwritten Character Recognition](https://github.com/uksamarth/Machine-Learning-Project)
